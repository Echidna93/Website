  My name is Alexander Jack. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota with a B.Sc in Mathematics. I am a freelance coder who specializes in HTML/CSS, Postgre SQL and C++. As an ardent supporter of the conservation movement, my dream is to be deeply involved in conervation and management in my home state of Minnesota. I want to do that through data analysis, database management and volunteer work. 
</p>
<p>
  My career includes working as: a teacher's assistant through the University of Minnesota, an undergraduate researcher through the Monarch Joint Venture in the University of Minnesota, and the Mayo Clinic as a seasonal researcher. I also volunteer for Friends of the Mississippi--an organization that does restorations of native habitat as well as community outreach. I also will begin volunteering for the organization CLUES as well. Where I will help people in ESOL programs get the services they need.
